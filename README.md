# Voyager Golden Record Decoder

## About
The Golden Record on the Voyager spacecraft contains 
audio of Earth sounds, as well as encoded images.

The surface of the record case is engraved with pictograms
that describe how to decode these images from the record.

The purpose of this code is to attempt to replicate this
process and produce the images from the disk.
